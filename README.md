We are going to develop the classic Atari game “Pong”.

Rules

2 sides will play the game
Every side will have a vertical saver (stick or whatever :) width of 20px height 10% of screen<br>
Savers must be  5% away from left and right side of the window.<br>
There will be a 20px x 20px square ball which has a constant speed to a direction.<br>
When ball hit saver or Top of the screen or  bottom of the screen the ball will be reflected like a mirror. For ex if ball hits with 30’ it will leave with 150’ (+ - 10').<br>
If ball reaches left or right side the ball disappears and opponent gets point.<br>
The ball creates in center and goes to a random direction between (30’ 150’)<br>
Make a scoreboard. <br>
5 point wins.<br>
Save the game into local storage and resume on another page.<br>
Use W up S down for left player up arrow and down arrow for right player<br>
Game ends when there is no ball.<br>

The project will be tested on https://www.lcwaikiki.com/tr-TR/TR, so please develop it accordingly. (It can be an extension or run by pasting it in console).<br>
The project will be deployed on bitbucket, you can clone the URL below along with the Repository onto your local environment.<br>
